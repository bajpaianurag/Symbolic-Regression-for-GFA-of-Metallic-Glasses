Classifier_check_for_generated_compositions.py contains Python code for building and evaluating classification models for multicomponent alloy compositions. Several classifiers are defined, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVM, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, and a Neural Network model built built to classify multicomponent metallic glasses from crystalline alloys.

Data_preprocessing_and_feature_selction.py contains Python code for preprocessing data and performing feature selection for regression model

Generate_new_MG_compostions_GAN_VAE.py contains Python code for generating new MMG compositions using a Variational Autoencoders (VAE). The code defines methods for constructing the generator, discriminator, and encoder models for the GAN-VAE framework. These models work to generate and refine new compositions based on latent space representations.

Regression_GFA_Metallic_Glasses.py contains Python code for performing regression analysis on glass-forming ability (GFA) of multicomponent metallic glasses. Multiple regression models, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVM, Lasso, Ridge, ElasticNet, K-Nearest Neighbors, and neural networks, are applied to predict the target values (Tg, Tx, and Tl).

Symbolic_Regression_Code.py contains Python code for dimensions embedded symbolic regression using genetic programming to model the glass-forming ability (GFA) or related properties.
